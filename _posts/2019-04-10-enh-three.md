## Enhancement Three: Data Bases

For this milestone, I have started creating my database enhancements for my Discord Bot.  Although I have not completed this yes, I have done a lot of the groundwork and created the mongodb database file that I will be using to make the calls through my discord bot.  This was a lot of copy/paste work because there were 335 gems that I had to gather the information for and put into a mongodb style file to use for this project.  I have included a zip file of my project so far, and I plan to make the rest of the enhancements to this project next week.

A big reason that I selected this enhancement for my project is because it was something that I really wanted to do anyway.  I made the discord bot some time ago with plans to make it into something cool, but never really got around to doing anything with it.  I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to get my feet wet and really start trying to enhance this bot to include some useful functionality for my friends and I to use while we are playing Path of Exile.

My enhancements to this artifact demonstrate my skills with databases, and my ability to use JavaScript.  Here are the first few lines of the file I created:

gem_name,gem_quality

Abyssal Cry,20% increased Skill Effect Duration`n (1% per 1% Q)

Added Chaos Damage Support,10% increased Chaos Damage`n (0.5% per 1% Q)

Added Cold Damage Support,10% increased Cold Damage`n (0.5% per 1% Q)

Added Fire Damage Support,10% increased Fire Damage`n (0.5% per 1% Q)

Added Lightning Damage Support,10% increased Lightning Damage`n (0.5% per 1% Q)

Additional Accuracy Support,20% increased Accuracy Rating`n (1% per 1% Q)

Advanced Traps Support,10% increased Trap Damage`n (0.5% per 1% Q)

Ancestral Call Support,10% increased Attack Speed`n (0.5% per 1% Q)

Ancestral Protector,20% increased Totem Damage`n (1% per 1% Q)

Ancestral Warchief,20% increased Totem Damage`n (1% per 1% Q)

Anger,20% increased Area of Effect`n (1% per 1% Q)

Animate Guardian,Minions have 40% increased Movement Speed`n (2% per 1% Q)

Animate Weapon,Minions have 40% increased Movement Speed`n (2% per 1% Q)

Arc,10% chance to Shock enemies`n (0.5% per 1% Q)

Arcane Surge Support,10% increased Spell Damage`n (0.5% per 1% Q)


When I’m through, the idea of this project’s functionality will be that a user can type, for example, “!Abyssal Cry” into discord, and MineBot will return “20% increased Skill Effect Duration`n (1% per 1% Q)”.  While the project is not quite there yet, I made a lot of time-consuming progress that I am happy with.  I am excited to continue to take this artifact to the next level and develop the rest of the functionality piece in the coming week.

## Update

I was able to get this part of the project working properly.  This was definitely the most time consuming part of my project and I learned a lot from struggling through it.  Here is a screenshot of it working:
