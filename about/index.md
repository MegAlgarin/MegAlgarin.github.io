## About Me
Hi, I'm Meg.

Originally from Kapolei, HI, I now live in Fitchburg, MA with my husband and three-year-old daughter.

I currently work as a Survey Programmer for Research Results and I love what I do.  I'm also nearing completion of my BS in Computer Science from Southern New Hampshire University.

I proudly served six years in the United States Navy as a Second Class Petty Officer Cryptologic Technician - Technical and was honorably discharged in 2017.

In my spare time, I love PC gaming.  Historically, I have loved all Blizzard games, though recently it has been a lot of League of Legends and Path of Exile.
